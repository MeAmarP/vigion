# VIGION [Vigilant Vision]: Real-Time Crime Activity detection
## Problem Statement:
Surveillance is one of the prime method used by governments and law enforcement agencies
for prevention of the criminal or suspicious activities.

Traditional digital video surveillance system only performs capturing & storing of video feed,
where security operator has the task to look for any threat or suspicious activity by constantly
watching video feeds.

Today, there are or more cameras and recorded video than ever before, due to which security
operators are faced with challenge of keeping pace. Thus, human monitoring of surveillance is
very tough and error-prone job.

This could lead to failure in identifying suspicious or criminal activity in progress and thus
delay in response time to the incident. Which arises the critical question of public safety.

## Summary:
Traditional Surveillance systems are passive and reactive. Which allow investigating the
incident rather than preventing it.
+ VIGION is edge intelligent device using Computer Vision and Deep Neural Network.
+ It can detect real time criminal activities like Abuse, Arrest, Assault, Burglary and
Fighting.
+ VIGION can alert (SMS/Email) user or law enforcement agency about the incident.
+ VIGION is a portable and low cost device using Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano as it's brain.

_Considering the fact that, Security and Surveillance systems are integral part of commercial
and residential establishments. VIGION can play important role of maintaining public safety in
such area_.
